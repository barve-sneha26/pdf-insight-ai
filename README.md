## FocusedPDF: Leveraging LLMs for In-Depth Analysis of a Single Document
 
## Project Overview
This project is a learning and exploration initiative focused on generative AI and its practical applications. The core objective was to build a system that can perform question answering on a single PDF document using a large language model (LLM). By integrating OpenAI's API for advanced language understanding, LangChain for seamless model management, and AstraDB as a scalable vector database, the project demonstrates how cutting-edge AI models can be effectively combined with modern data storage solutions to extract meaningful insights from unstructured text.

Python was used to orchestrate the interactions between the LLM, vector database, and PDF parsing modules. This project not only serves as a hands-on experience with generative AI technologies but also showcases the potential of these tools in automating and enhancing document analysis tasks.
